# Productivity Mobile-Web Application – Diploma Project

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a hybrid mobile web application focused on personal productivity, developed as part of my undergraduate thesis.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of the project was to design and implement a simple and accessible productivity app that allows users to manage tasks, monitor progress, and store data in the cloud. The application was built using web technologies and converted into a mobile app using Apache Cordova.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **User Authentication**  
  Secure login and registration system using Firebase Authentication.

- **Task Management**  
  Add, view, and delete tasks with options for priority, deadline, and project labeling.

- **Progress Overview**  
  Visual indicators of task completion and daily productivity statistics.

- **User Profile**  
  Displays basic user data with logout functionality.

- **Cloud Integration**  
  All data is stored and synchronized in Firebase Firestore.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Front-End
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Firebase (Authentication, Firestore Database)

### Mobile Integration
- Apache Cordova (conversion to APK)  
- Cordova plugins for potential native functionality (e.g., Bluetooth)

### UI Design
- Figma for initial interface planning and prototyping

## 📱 Platform Target

The app was developed as a **hybrid mobile web application**, optimized for Android devices. Although not officially published on the Google Play Store, the distribution process is described and documented as part of the thesis.

## 🔒 Firebase Configuration

The application uses Firebase for:
- User authentication
- Secure cloud-based task storage
- Real-time data syncing

## 📦 Deployment

While the app was not formally released to the Play Store due to time and cost constraints, the APK is ready for deployment, and the publishing process is described in detail in the thesis.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `index.html` – Main HTML structure
- `styles.css` – CSS styling
- `script.js` – JavaScript logic
- `img/` – Icons and profile images


## 📄 Thesis Document

The full diploma thesis (in Slovene) includes:
- A theoretical overview of application types and development processes
- Implementation details of the productivity application
- Technology comparison and justification
- Distribution strategy (Google Play)
